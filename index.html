        <p class="forpara">Charity is no solution to poverty. It may help stop the process of pauperisation getting worse. If charity is not used for right purpose, it takes away the initiative from the people. Charity sometimes helps us to shield ourselves from paying attention to the essence of the problem of poverty. It allows us to get ahead with our lives without worrying about poor people.s lives. It allows our conscience to remain insulated.
